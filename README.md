# Hi there, I'm Krish Patel! 👋

I am a **Software Engineering Undergraduate** transitioning into **Quantitative Analytics**. I specialize in building rigorous data pipelines and applying advanced mathematical models (like Topological Data Analysis) to financial and biometric datasets.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **Quantitative Research:** Analyzing 40 years of NASDAQ-100 data using TDA and Graph Laplacian diffusion.
* **Embedded Analytics:** designing real-time data acquisition systems with millisecond precision.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL (PostgreSQL), C/C++, Bash, Assembly.
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering, FP-Growth.
* **Advanced Math:** Topological Data Analysis (Gudhi), Graph Theory, Statistical Modeling.
* **Tools:** Git, Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks, Linux.

### 📈 Featured Insights
* **Market Regimes:** Used persistent homology to detect non-linear crash signals in the NASDAQ-100.
* **Biometric Accuracy:** Engineered a bidirectional timing algorithm improving data validity from 87% to 99.5%.
